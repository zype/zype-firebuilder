# Zype Fire App Builder Template

This SDK allows you to set up an eye-catching, easy to use Amazon Fire video streaming app integrated with the Zype platform with minimal coding and configuration. The app is built on top of Amazon Fire App builder with java framework using Zype API. With minimal setup you can have your Fire app up and running.

## Fire App Builder

Fire App Builder is a java framework that allows developers to quickly build immersive, java based Android media applications for Fire TV, without writing code.  Fire App Builder accomplishes this by using a plug and play java framework with easy configuration files.  Developers simply specify the format of their media feed in a json file and add resources for logos and colors to create a rich media TV experience quickly.  Fire App Builder supports multiple modules for Analytics, Authentication and Advertising that you can enable for your app.

Full Documentation for Fire App Builder is located [here](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/devices/fire-tv/docs/fire-app-builder-overview).

## Creating Custom App Based on the Template<a name="template"></a>

1. Select `templateDebug` (or `templateRelease`) build variant for `app`, `PurchaseInterface`  and `ZypeAPI` modules

2. In `PurchaseInterface/build.gradle` and `Application/ZypeAPI/build.gradle` files set `defaultPublishConfig` parameter to `templateRelease` value.

3. Replace following placeholders with actual values:

  **Application/ZypeAPI/src/main/java/com/zype/fire/api/ZypeSettings.java**
```
    public static final String APP_KEY = "";
    public static final String CLIENT_ID = "";
    public static final String ROOT_PLAYLIST_ID = "";
```

Also replace features and monetization options placeholders with `true` or `false` values.

**Application/app/build.gradle**
- ```<APPLICATION_ID>``` - used to identify your app on the device and in the marketplace. Must be unique and usually is following `com.yourdomain.aftv` pattern.

**Application/app/src/template/res/values/strings.xml**
- ```<APP_NAME>```
- ```<APP_NAME_SHORT>```

**Application/app/src/template/res/values-en/strings.xml**
**Application/app/src/template/res/values-de/strings.xml**
**Application/app/src/template/res/values-ja/strings.xml**
- ```<APP_NAME>```

**Application/app/src/template/res/values/custom.xml**
- ```<BRAND_COLOR>``` - hex color used for highlighting buttons and widgets

4. Update following resources:

**Company logo**

*Application/app/src/template/res/drawable/logo_company.png*

Image dimensions should be approximately 356 x 108 px and have a transparent background.

**App icon**

- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png*
- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png*
- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png*
- *Application/app/src/template/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png*

You can use icon generator in Android Studio to produce icons with required dimensions from 512x512 source icon image.

5. Setup UI options

**App theme**

The app supports both dark and light themes.  
The default appearance is dark, where the screen background is black/dark grey, and text elements are white/light grey.
The Light theme will display all screens with white background and black/grey text elements.

To enable light theme:  
  - Set `LIGHT_THEME` feature flag to `true` in the *Application/ZypeAPI/src/main/java/com/zype/fire/api/ZypeSettings.java* file
  - Update the following values in the *Application/app/src/template/res/values/custom.xml* file:

| ***Attribute name***                 | ***Light theme***      | ***Dark theme***      |
|:-------------------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
|`background`                          |#FFFFFF           |#22282E           |
|`spinner_color`                       |#FF000000         |#FFFFFFFF         |
|`primary_text`                        |#E6000000         |#E6FFFFFF         |
|`secondary_text`                      |#99000000         |#E6FFFFFF         |
|`tertiary_text`                       |#99000000         |#99FFFFFF         |
|`search_edit_text_bg_color`           |#4D000000         |#4DFFFFFF         |
|`search_edit_text_bg_color_unfocused` |#1A000000         |#1AFFFFFF         |



**Left menu**

Left menu will appear when the user press `Menu` button on the device retomte control. It contains the same actions like Settings row at the bottom of the main screen.
This option is turned off by default. To turn it on make the method `displayLeftMenu()` in the `ZypeConfiguration.java` return `true` value.

**Watched bar**

The watched bar is displayed on the video thumbnail and shows the time that user watched this video.
This option is turned on by default. To turn it off make the method `displayWatchedBarOnVideoThumbnails()` in the `ZypeConfiguration.java` return `false` value.

6. Analytics

**Segment analytics**

To enable Segment Analytics:
- In the ***settings.gradle*** file uncomment lines referencing to `SegmentAnalyticsComponent`.
- In the ***app/build.gradle*** file uncomment the following row:   
```    
    compile project(':SegmentAnalyticsComponent')
```
- Rebuild the project

***Note:** You can find detail instructions on adding and removing Fire App Builder components [here](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-app-builder/load-a-component.html#loadcomponent)* 

Setting up Segment Analytics:
- In the `SegmentAnalyticsComponent` module open the ***res/values/values.xml*** file and set your Segment write key in this line:
```
    <string name="segment_analytics_write_key">Your WRITE_KEY here</string>
```
